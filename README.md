# PyMoments

This is a Python library for calculating rotational constants from some standard forms of
input, for example XYZ and Z-matrix representations. Additionally, there is some high-level
functionality that will help streamline certain workflows involving rotational constants;
the most useful probably is the ability to automatically compute isotopic shifts for common
isotopologues.
